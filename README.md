# CP Field Links
## v. 1.0

CP Field Links is a tiny utility plugin making content modelling a little bit easier in Craft.

When `devMode` is enabled, CP Field Links will augment your element editing forms with handy links to easily edit individual fields, or even element sources and field layouts.

_Did you forget what that one field's _handle_ was, again?_ Mouse over the cogwheel; CP Field Links will tell you.

## Installation

1. Download, unzip and put the `cpfieldlinks` folder in `craft/plugins`
2. Install from CP

_Please note that `devMode` needs to be enabled for CP Field Links to work. Well, it doesn't actually _need_ to, but I designed it that way._

## Disclaimer

This plugin is totally free, and you can do whatever you want with it (and to it). CP Field Links is unlikely to mess up your stuff, but if it does, the author takes absolutely no responsibility.
