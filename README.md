# CP Field Links
## v. 1.1

CP Field Links is a tiny utility plugin making content modelling a little bit easier in Craft.

For all admin users, CP Field Links will augment your element editing forms with handy links to easily edit individual fields, or even element sources and field layouts.

_Did you forget what that one field's_ handle _was, again?_ Mouse over the cogwheel; CP Field Links will tell you.
